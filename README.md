# [Surriculum v2.5](https://beficent.github.io/surriculum/)

Surriculum is an interactive graduation planner for Sabanci University undergraduate programs. The entire application runs in the browser using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It lets you build a semester-by-semester plan, track program requirements and check whether you are on course to graduate.

A live instance is available at [beficent.github.io/surriculum](https://beficent.github.io/surriculum/).

## Using the tool

Clone this repository or download the source and open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No build step or server is required.

The interface allows you to:

- Select your major and an optional double major
- Add semesters and drag courses from the catalog
- Import your Academic Records Summary (HTML or PDF) to prefill taken courses. Or alternatively import your YÃ–K Transcript PDF file.
- Add custom courses manually
- Check graduation status and view a summary of remaining requirements for each major
- Toggle between light and dark themes or follow your system preference
- Collapse the sidebar to maximize planning space
- Insert new semesters and courses using "+ New Semester" and "+ Add course" ghosts
- Show the course details in the Add Course dropdown list using the "Show Course Details" toggle
- Hide courses you've already added using the "Hide Taken Courses" toggle

Always verify graduation requirements yourself. For issues or suggestions, contact [bilal.gebenoglu@sabanciuniv.edu](mailto:bilal.gebenoglu@sabanciuniv.edu), or start a discussion/issue on the repository.

## Updating course data

Course catalogs for each program are stored as JSON files under `courses/`. To refresh them or add new programs:

1. Edit `fetch_courses.py` if the university site changes and run `python fetch_courses.py` to regenerate the JSON files. The scraper now downloads data for every term starting from Fall 2019 and stores them under `courses/<TERM>/`. A `terms.json` file indicates which majors are available for each term.
2. Use `update_credits.py` when Basic Science and Engineering credit values need to be extracted from official CSV/HTML sources.
3. Run `python fetch_requirements.py` to scrape updated graduation rules into the JSON files under `requirements/`. Update matching messages in `main.js` if necessary.

When using the planner, select your major and specify the entry term for both your main major and optional double major. Course lists and graduation requirements adjust automatically based on the selected terms.

After updating data, manually test with various course combinations to ensure the graduation checker behaves correctly.
